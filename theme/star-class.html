        <p>The sun is a G2V type star which is a yellow dwarf and a main sequence star. Stars are classified by their spectra which are the elements that they absorb along with their temperature. There are currently seven different types of stars. From the highest to lowest temperature it goes O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. The O and B stars are rare but very bright while the M stars are common but quite dim compared to the others.</p>
        <p>The Hertzprung-Russell diagram shows the spectral type or surface temperature vs. its luminosity which is its intrinsic brightness or absolute magnitude. Most stars are main sequence stars just like the sun in our Solar System, they are very bright and very hot. The hotter the star the brighter they are. This stable part lasts about five billion years. Once that stage is over, the star begins to die and become giants and supergiants. The hydrogen supply is depleted in these old stars and are close to exploding into a planetary nebula or supernova. After the explosion, they become white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. These different types all depend on the mass of the star. Our sun is a small star and in time will eventaully become faint white dwarfs due to it depleting its nuclear fuels. Small stars like our sun will eventaully become black dwarfs which are cold and dark.</p>
