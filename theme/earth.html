        <p>The bright light in the background is the sun, a massive burning star rising over earth. The sun is a sphere of hot plasma that accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system and is the star at the center of our solar system. The immediate planet is earth, the planet we thrive in. It is the third closest planet to the sun and is approximately 4.5 billion years old. It is the only known planet that contains living organisms to date.</p>

                <p>Earth is our home planet and the third planet closest to the Sun. It is the only known planet that supports life. It is the fifth largest planet in the Solar System and the only known planet in our system to have liquid water on the surface. The Earth title is about one thousand years ago and is Germanic for the ground. Its radius is 3,959 miles long and is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun (93 million miles).</p>

                <p>It takes about eight minutes for sunlight to reach Earth. The Earth completes one rotation around its axis every twenty four hours and completes a full orbit around the Sun every 365 days or one Earth year. Every four years, we add a leap day and the year we add it is called a leap year. Earth's axis is tilted at 23.4 degrees and is why we have the yearly seasons. Earth was formed by gravity pulling in swirling dust and gas about 4.5 billion years ago.</p>

                <p>The four main layers of Earth are the inner core, outer core, the mantle, and the crust. The inner core is 759 miles in radius and a solid heap of iron and nickel and is about 9,800 degrees fahrenheit. The outer core is 1,400 miles thick and made of iron and nickel fluids. The mantle is a mixture of hot molten rock and is about 1,800 miles thick. Finally, the crust is about 19 miles thick. Earth has mountains, valleys, volcanos, etc. Seventy percent of Earth is covered by Oceans which are on average 2.5 miles deep and contain about 97 percent of Earth's water. Earth has an atmosphere that consists of seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen, and one percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon.</p>
