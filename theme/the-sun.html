                <p>The Sun, also known as Sol, is a type G2V yellow dwarf main sequence star, that currently reesides in the center of our Solar System. The shape of the Sun is an almost perfect sphere and consists of hot plasma that burns up to 10,000 degrees fahrenheit on the surface making anything it touches disintegrate. With the convective motion, it generates a magnetic field through a dynamo process. The sun is single handedly giving all life on Earth possible and is essential to the survival of all biological organims including us humans.</p>
                <p>The Sun is 109 times the diameter of Earth and weighs about 330,000 times heavier than Earth. The gravity from the Sun keeps our Solar System together and the electric currents from the Sun generate a magnetic field that is passed on through the Solar System by the solar wind. The interactions between the Earth and the Sun create the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and aurorae. The Sun has a radius of 432,168.6 miles and is equivalent to the mass of 332,946 Earths. The Sun is the largest star in our Solar System, but very small compared to countless other stars. It would take 1.3 million Earths to fill in the Sun. The closest neighbor the Sun has is the Alpha Centauri triple star system consisting of Proxima Centauri (4.24 light years away) and Alpha Centauri A and B whom orbit one another (4.37 light years away).</p>
                <p>Our Sun is located in the spiral arm known as the Orion Spur that extends out from the Sagittarius arm. Our solar system is moving at an average speed of 450,000 miles per hour. It would taake our Solar System 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the center of the Milky Way. The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way with an axial tilt of 7.25 degrees. The sun is not a solid body so it actually rotates different parts at different rates. The Sun's equator does a full orbit in 25 days while at the poles it takes about 36 days.</p>

                <p>A solar nebula was formed about 4.5 years ago and as it collapsed because of the gravity it formed a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the Sun which resulted in the Sun accounting for 99.8% of the mass in our Solar System. Scientists predict that the Sun is reaching near its half life and still has another 6.5 billion years until it starts to die. When it begins to reach the end of its life it swells and it is predicted that Mercury and Venus are to be engulfed and a possibility that Earth will too. When it dies it shrinks and becomes a white dwarf.</p>
                <p>The Sun is a ball of gas that is made up of in terms of atoms, 91.0% hydrogen and 8.9% helium and in terms of mass, 70.6% hydrogen and 27.4% helium. The Suns's mass is held up by gravitational attraction, producing immense pressure and temperature at its core. The six regions of the Sun are the core, radiative zone, convective zone, protosphere, chromosphere, and the the corona.</p>
                <p>The temperature at its core is about 27 million degrees fahrenheit. The energy in the core is carried outward by radiation which collides all over the radiative zone, it takes 170,000 years to reach the convective zone from the core. In the convective zone, the temperature drops below 3.5 million degrees fahrenheit. At the surface it is about 10,000 degrees fahrenheit. The surface (protosphere) is aa 300 mile thick region where the radiation escapes. We see radiation as sunlight at eight minutes after leaving the Sun.</p>

                <p>Above the photosphere is the tenuous chromosphere and the corona also known as the crown, which makes up the thin solar atmosphere. This is the locations where we see sunspots and solar flares. It is hard to see visible light from these regions against the protosphere and can only be clearly seen when a solar eclipse occurs where wee can see thee edges that look like a ring. The higher that alitude in the Sun's atmosphere, the higher the temperature.</p>
                <p>Life on the Sun is by default impossible due to the extreme heat. However, it gives life to our planet, Earth. A complex magnetic field is formed when the Sun generates electric currents and the fields extend out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field. The volume of space controlled by the field is called the heliosphere. The magnetic field is carried outward through solar winds. Since the Sun rotates, the magnetic field spirals outwards, this is known as the Parker spiral.</p>
                <p>Every eleven years the Sun's poles change their magnetic polarity. This causes the calm protosphere, corona, and chromosphere violently active. At the height of the Sun's activity called Solar maximum, it releases solar storms, sunspots, solr flares, and coronal mass ejections. The irregularities in the Sun's magnetic fields cause these events which release huge amounts of energy at a time. This as a result, can damage satellites, pipelines, and power grids.</p>
