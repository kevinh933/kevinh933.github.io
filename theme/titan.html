        <p>This is Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. It is also the second largest natural satellite in our Solar System. Jupiter's moon, Ganymede is only about two percent larger than Titan. So far, this is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere and the only known planet/moon to have a stable liquid surface other than our earth. A little fun fact about Titan is that it is actually larger than the planet Mercury which makes it a very large moon.</p>
        <p>Titan is made up of mostly nitrogen just like earth; however, it has a surface pressure that is fifty percent higher than Earth's. Titan has clouds, rivers ,rain, lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane making it quite similar to Earth's atmosphere. Titan has large seas which can go to hundreds of miles wide and deep. It consists of frozen water and beneath that even more water rather than methane. Scientists predict that Titan's water could harbor life; however, it could also be void of life.</p>
        <p>Titan is one of the most habital worlds in our Solar System due to the dense nitrogen atmosphere; however, humans would need an oxygen mask and suits that protect us from the very cold temperatures. Titan's surface temperature would be around minus 290 degrees fahrenheit making it too cold for humans to survive in without protection. The rain would also fall more slower than Earth's and it has a similar atmosphere and gravity of Earth's moon.</p>
