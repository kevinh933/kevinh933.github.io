        <p>My knowledge on programming is quite limited with only learning the basics of Python and Java years back along with some computer graphics along the way to see where it went. So, I would say my knowledge on programming is pretty low. By taking this class, I hope I can extend my knowledge on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

            I enjoy playing videogames, hiking, and hanging out with friends. I also like computers a lot and have my own setup that I have been upgrading bit by bit every year.</p>
