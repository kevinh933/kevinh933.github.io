        <p>This is an image of Saturn, the sixth planet from our sun and the second largest planet in our immediate Solar System with Jupiter being the largest. it classifies as a gas giant with aan average radius of nine times that of our planet, Earth. However, it only has one eighth the average density of Earth. Compared to Earth it has a much larger volume, being over 95 times larger tahn Earth.</p>

                <p>Saturn is a large and beautiful system of icy rings which makes it quite unique compared to the other planets in our Solar System. However, it isn't the only planet to have rings, but it does have a more complex system of rings. It currently has about 60 known moons orbiting the giant. A well known moon of Saturn is Titan, a moon known for its methane lakes and high amounts of nitrogen.</p>
                <p>The planet is named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who also happened to be the father of Jupiter. Saturn has a radius of 36,183.7 miles which is about nine times wider than Earth's. It is about 890 million miles from the Sun or nine and a half astronomical units away from the sun. An astronomical unit (AU) is the distance from the Sun to the Earth. This would take the sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.</p>
                <p>Saturn also has the second shortest day in the Solar System with only about 10.7 hours in a day which means it takes 10.7 hours for Saturn to do a 360 degree rotation once around its axis. it makes a complete orbit around the sun in about 29.4 Earth years or 10,756 Earth days.</p>

            <h2>Saturn Part Two</h2>
            <figure class="left">
                <img src="../images/saturn2.jpg" alt="saturn two">
                <p>Similar to Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of helium and hydrogen. Saturn's center core consists of metal such as iron and nickel which is surrounded by dense rocky material formed over the years of heat and intense pressure. Saturn is the only planet in our Solar System to have an average density that is less than water which means it could float in a body of water even with its massive size. </p>
                <p>The planet doesn't exactly have a real surface due to it being made of gases abd liquids that reach deep down. This means there is no solid surface to land on which makes it very interesting. The planet does have very extreme pressure and temperatures and would very likely vaporize humans and other objects.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere consists of clouds that appear in different forms from jet streams, storms, and stripes. The colors consist of many different shades of yellow, brown, and grey. The atmospheric winds reach up to sixteen hundred feet per second in then upper atmosphere which is far more dangerous than the hurricane wins on Earth. The pressure is so strong that is squeezes gas into liquid.</p>
                <p>Scientists predict that the harsh environments on Saturn do not support any form of life due to the extreme pressures and temperatures. However, some of the moons like Enceladus and Titan do seem to have characteristics that support life even though the planet they orbit is too extreme for habital life. Saturn currently has fifty three confimred moons and twenty nine provisional moons that await confirmation.</p>

            <h2>Saturn Part Three</h2>
            <figure class="left">
                <img src="../images/saturnsolarsystem.jpg" alt="saturn solar system">
                <p>Saturns rings are what make the planet very interesting and quite unique. Scientists believe that the rings on Saturn were from pieces of comets, shattered moons, and asteroids that were torn apart before they reached the planet due to the immense gravitational pull. It is believed that Saturn's rings are made of billions of pieces of ice and rock caoted in dust. The sizes ranged from tiny dust particles to house sized rocks with very few being as big as mountains.</p>
                <p>The rings appear to be mostly white and each ring has a different orbit with different speeds. The rings would extend up to 175,000 miles from the planet itself with the vertical height being about 30 feet inside the main rings. The rings are named alphabetically and are relatively close to eachother with an exception of the Cassini Division which has a gap of 2,920 miles and seperates rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C with D, E, F, and G being more faint and recently discovered. From Saturn going outwards the rings order by the D ring, C ring, B ring, the Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and the E ring. There is an additional ring that orbits Phoebe, one of Saturns many moons.</p>
                <p>Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than of Jupiter's; however, it is 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Everything including the rings and satellites are all within the magnetosphere. When charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along the magnetic field lines, an Aurorae appears. For Earth, this happens because of the solar winds. However, for Saturn's Aurorae it doesn't seem to be affected by the solar winds, but instead, a combination of particles laucnhed from Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation rate.</p>
