        <p>This is the Moon also known as Luna, the only moon and the only permanent natural satellite of earth. It is currently the fifth largest natural satellite in our Solar System, and the largest satellite among other planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits. Talking about size, it is about a quarter or one fourth of the size of Earth, the planet it orbits. It is about 238,855 miles away from Earth and has a twenty seven day orbit around our planet.</p>
        <p>Thhe moon does not have it's own source of light. Instead, it uses the light from the sun by simply reflecting it which causes it to glow during the night. The moon takes on different stages during its orbit due to the sun reflecting different parts of the moon as it goes through its monthly cycle. There is a far side of the moon due to the moon rotating on its own axis at the same rate as it orbits Earth making us see the same side of the moon. The cycle goes from a new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent, and back to a new moon in its full twenty seven day cycle.</p>
        <p>Scientists predict that the Moon formed early on in the solar system’s history just after Earth and an object relative to the size of Mars smashed into each other. The collision sent chunks of Earth and the impactor flying into space that were then pulled back together by the gravity which then formed the moon.</p>
