        <p>This is an image of the Milky Way taken from earth. This is the galaxy that contains our solar system which holds earth, the home planet we reside in. Our solar system has eight planets so far. The planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>

                <p>The Solar System we currently reside in officially contains eight planets which are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. However, there are four unofficial planets that are part of our system according to the proposed resolutions. These are Pluto which is commonly known, Charon, Pluto's moon, Ceres, an asteroid, and UB313 which also goes by the alias Xena.</p> 
                    <p>The Milky Way gets its name from a Greek myth about the goddess Hera who sprayed milk across the sky. In other parts of the world there are different stories such as China. In China, they call it the Silver River and in South Africa they call it the Backbone of Night. Different cultures have different names for the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
                        <p>As seen in popular images of the galaxy it takes the shape of a spiral like circle which is thin if you would look at it from a side angle. The thin spiral meets a gravitational center which looks like a big bump from a side angle. The galaxy is kept together by the gravitational pull from the black hole at the center of the Milky Way which pulls in everything in the vicinity causing the spiral circle shape. If the gravity were absent, the stars would drift away.</p> 
                            <p>The massive black hole at the center of the galaxy is about 26,000 light years away from earth. There about 10 million stars within one parsec of the center of the galaxy which is also called the galactic center. One parsec is about 3.26 light years and a light year is the distance light travels in one earth year. In terms of light years to miles it would be approximately 5.88e+12 miles which is a lot.</p>

                <figcaption>The visual order of planets from the Sun</figcaption>
                <p>The order of the planets starting from the planet closest to the sun is Mercury which is about 35.98 million miles away from the sun. The second closest planet is Venus which is approximately 67.24 million miles away. The third closest planet is Earth which is about 92.96 million miles away. The fourth closest is Mars which is about 141.6 million miles away. The fifth closest is Jupiter which is about 483.8 million miles away. The sixth closest is Saturn which is about 890.8 million miles out. The seventh planet would be Uranus at about 1.784 billion miles away. Lastly, the eighth planet is Neptune at a whopping 2.793 billion miles away from the sun.</p> 
                    <p>These are the eight official planets and does not include Ceres, Pluto, etc. Ceres is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The rest of the planets including dwarf planets are on the outer Solar System. The order of the outer planets from closest to furthest are Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.</p>

            <h2>Elliptical Orbit</h2>
            <figure class="left">

                <figcaption>The elliptical path the planets take during orbit</figcaption>
                <p>In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics, an elliptic orbit or as seen in the title, elliptical orbit is a Kepler orbit with an eccentricity that is less than one. It includes the special case of a circular orbit, with eccentricity that is eqqual to 0. In a more detailed matter, it is a Kepler orbit with eccentricity that is lesser than one and greater than zero.</p> 
                    <p>Johannes Keppler discovered in the seventeenth century that the orbits the planets would traveel along were actually ellipses which focused around the sun. This would be described in Keppler's first law of planetary motion. This was later followed up by Issac Newton who would form his law of universal gravitation based around Keppler's law of planetary motion.</p>
                    <p>The planets in our Solar System orbit around the sun in an ellipses due to the sun being the largest star within the system making it the strongest gravitational pull. This results in the other eight planets revolving around the large burning star.</p>
